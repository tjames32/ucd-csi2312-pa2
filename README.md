PA2
My files from PA2 were not compiling correctly to begin with. There was an error in main.cpp that continuously arised that stated that
"a function-definition is not allowed here before '{' token" where I cannot see a definition being made before '{'.

I know this code is not near complete and I will continue to work on it until it runs as expected.
